# if-maker

A text-based game engine.

## Install

- Download `ifm.py` in the root folder of the repository, then run `python3 ifm.py install`(network access is needed).
- Or, download `ifm.py` and `src/*` in the root folder of the repository.

We recommend to edit the source code of your project with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Also we developed two extensions for VSCode to edit `ifd` and `ift` file more effectively, just search `ifd-highlighter` and `ift-highlighter` in the extension window of VSCode to install them.

## Usage

- `python3 ifm.py install` to install if-maker.
- `python3 ifm.py new` to create a new project.
- `python3 ifm.py make` to compile your project.
- `python3 ifm.py run` to run your project.
- `python3 ifm.py debug` to compile, run and debug your project.
- `python3 ifm.py clear` to clear your project.
